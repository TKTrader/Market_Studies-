Some examples of charts that I created in R for the purpose of analyzing different instruments (mainly ZC, ZW, ZS, CL) with regard to day types, high and low breaks; these charts were created for context and context alone in day trading. 

As the programs were written for my personal use to answer or examine specific questions on intraday and daily price action, they are not "properly" commented or formatted for industry/3rd party consumption.
